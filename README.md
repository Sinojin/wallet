# Wallet Api

There is only one wallet available which is called "1234"

Unit test is implemented only domain structer.(Unit test framework wasn't used) Going below zero rule is solved in domain area(it could be solved in business layer but for this example I thought it is not big deal).

I added docker-compose for development enviorment (mysql and redis).

Logrus is used but this is not good way but this is best way to give opinion about my framework usage

I didn't make middleware for authentication  

Application starts at "8888" port (I didnt put config)

Thank you for reading
